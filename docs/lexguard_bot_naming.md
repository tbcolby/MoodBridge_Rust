# LexGuard-Bot Naming Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the process for assigning a unique, wu-bot taxonomized name to the Legal Ethics and Compliance Bot in the MoodBridge_Rust project.

## Bot Name: **LexGuard-Bot**

### Purpose
The goal is to provide the bot with a distinctive and meaningful identifier that both represents its function and aligns with the system's taxonomy.

### Naming Process

1. **Understand the Functionality:**
   - The bot functions as an intelligent assistant, helping users navigate legal technology, assess risk, and provide legal guidance based on user profile and operation context.

2. **Identify Key Characteristics:**
   - Legal expertise
   - Ethical guidance
   - Compliance monitoring
   - Intelligent interactions

3. **Choose Naming Convention:**
   - Use the wu-bot taxonomy, which follows a pattern of combining thematic elements and a suffix like "-Bot" to signify its role in automation.

4. **Combine Themes:**
   - Consider elements such as "Lex" for law, "Guard" for protection, and "Guide" for assistance.
   - Examples: LexGuard-Bot, LawGuide-Bot

5. **Finalize the Name:**
   - Select a name that is unique and reflects the core mission of the bot. 
   - **Selected Name: LexGuard-Bot**

6. **Document the Name:**
   - Record the chosen name in the project documentation and ensure it is used consistently across all references and codebase components.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Update Codebase:**
   - Rename existing references to the bot using the new name, LexGuard-Bot.
   - Ensure naming consistency in both the code and documentation.

2. **Update Documentation:**
   - Modify all relevant documentation to reflect the new name.
   - Describe the rationale behind the chosen name in the project wiki or documentation files.

3. **Communication:**
   - Inform the team and relevant stakeholders about the new name and its significance.
   - Encourage consistent use of the name in all communications.

4. **Future Considerations:**
   - Review the naming taxonomy periodically to ensure alignment with evolving project goals and external naming conventions.

### Rationale for "LexGuard-Bot"

- **"Lex"**: Derived from Latin "lex" meaning law, immediately identifies the bot's legal domain expertise
