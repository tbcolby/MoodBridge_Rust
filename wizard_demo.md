# MoodBridge Wizard Engine Demo

## Overview

I have successfully built a comprehensive Wizarding Design Engine for MoodBridge_Rust based on the Salesforce wizard pattern you referenced. Here's what I've implemented:

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Features Implemented

### 1. **Core Wizard Framework** (`src/wizard/mod.rs`)
- **WizardManager**: Central orchestrator for all wizard instances
- **WizardState**: Tracks user progress through multi-step workflows
- **WizardStep**: Individual step configuration with fields and validation
- **Field Types**: Text, TextArea, Email, Phone, Select, Radio, Checkbox, Currency, Date, etc.
- **Validation Engine**: Required fields, min/max length, patterns, email validation
- **Conditional Logic**: Show/hide fields based on user selections
- **Navigation Control**: Previous/Next buttons with progress tracking

### 2. **Case Creation Wizard** (`src/wizard/case_wizard.rs`)
A complete 5-step legal case creation wizard:

#### Step 1: Case Type Selection
- Primary case type (Family Law, Criminal Defense, Personal Injury, etc.)
- Dynamic subtypes based on selection
- Help text and validation

#### Step 2: Client Information
- Individual vs Business client toggle
- Conditional fields (first/last name for individuals, business name for corporations)
- Email and phone validation
- Required field enforcement

#### Step 3: Case Details
- Case title and description
- Opposing party information
- Court jurisdiction selection
- Priority level assignment

#### Step 4: Financial Information
- Billing type selection (Hourly, Flat Fee, Contingency, Retainer)
- Conditional rate fields based on billing type
- Numeric validation for monetary amounts

#### Step 5: Review and Confirmation
- Options to create initial tasks
- Send welcome email to client
- Schedule initial meeting
- Final review before case creation

### 3. **Salesforce Integration Wizard** (`src/wizard/integration_wizard.rs`)
A comprehensive 4-step Salesforce setup wizard:

#### Step 1: Authentication
- Salesforce instance URL validation
- OAuth 2.0 vs Username/Password selection
- URL pattern validation

#### Step 2: Data Mapping
- Sync direction configuration (bidirectional, one-way)
- Map legal cases to Salesforce objects (Case, Opportunity, Custom)
- Map clients to Salesforce objects (Account, Contact, Lead)

#### Step 3: Sync Settings
- Frequency selection (real-time, hourly, daily, manual)
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Webhook configuration

#### Step 4: Testing & Validation
- Connection testing
- Notification email setup
- Test sync execution

### 4. **Beautiful Web UI** (`src/wizard/handlers.rs`)
- **Modern Design**: Gradient backgrounds, hover effects, smooth animations
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar and step indicators
- **Interactive Forms**: Dynamic field rendering based on wizard configuration
- **Error Handling**: Real-time validation with user-friendly error messages

### 5. **Helper Utilities** (`src/wizard/steps.rs`)
- **StepBuilder**: Utility functions for creating common field types
- **FieldOptions**: Pre-built option sets (case types, billing types, jurisdictions)
- **ValidationHelpers**: Common validation rules
- **ConditionalHelpers**: Logic for field visibility

## üéØ Key Technical Features

### Architecture Patterns
- **Plugin System**: Easy to add new wizard types
- **Trait-based Design**: Modular and extensible
- **Async/Await**: Non-blocking operations
- **Type Safety**: Full Rust type system benefits

### Salesforce-Inspired Design
- **Multi-step Workflow**: Guided user experience
- **Field Dependencies**: Dynamic form behavior
- **Validation Engine**: Client and server-side validation
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators

### Integration Ready
- **REST API**: Full HTTP API for wizard operations
- **JSON Serialization**: Standard data exchange format
- **Database Persistence**: Wizard state storage
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new wizard types

## üöÄ API Endpoints

```
GET  /wizards              - Beautiful wizard selection UI
GET  /api/wizard-types     - Available wizard types
POST /api/wizards          - Create new wizard instance
GET  /api/wizards/:id      - Get wizard state
POST /api/wizards/submit   - Submit step data
```

## üì± User Experience

### Wizard Selection Screen
- Grid layout with wizard cards
- Icons, descriptions, and time estimates
- Hover effects and smooth animations

### Step-by-Step Interface
- Clean, modern form design
- Progress bar showing completion
- Previous/Next navigation
- Real-time validation feedback
- Help text and tooltips

### Mobile Responsive
- Touch-friendly interface
- Optimized for mobile screens
- Consistent experience across devices

## üîß Example Usage

The wizard engine is fully integrated into your MoodBridge application:

1. **Access via Main Dashboard**: Added wizard links to your existing dashboard
2. **REST API Integration**: Can be called from any frontend framework
3. **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new wizard types for different workflows

## üé® Design Philosophy

The wizard engine follows Salesforce's design patterns:
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show information when needed
- **Contextual Help**: Inline guidance and tooltips
- **Error Prevention**: Validation before submission
- **Clear Navigation**: Always know where you are and where you can go
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Important information stands out

## üîÆ Next Steps

The foundation is complete and ready for:
1. **Additional Wizard Types**: Project setup, client onboarding, document generation
2. **Advanced Validation**: Custom business rules and cross-field validation
3. **Integration**: Connect to actual Salesforce APIs
4. **Analytics**: Track wizard completion rates and user behavior
5. **Customization**: Brand-specific styling and field configurations

This wizard engine provides a solid foundation for creating guided user experiences throughout your legal case management system, just like Salesforce's Lightning Platform!
