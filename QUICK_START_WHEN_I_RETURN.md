# 🚀 When You Return - Quick Start Guide

## 📍 WHERE YOU LEFT OFF

You were building a comprehensive **enterprise platform integration system** for MoodBridge Rust, connecting it to:
- **Salesforce** (CRM)
- **AWS** (Cloud services)
- **Azure** (Cloud + AI services)
- **Snowflake** (Data warehouse)
- **ETL platforms** (Airflow, NiFi)

---

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS

### 1. Check Your Tasks
```bash
cd "/Users/tyler/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Legal/MoodBridge_Rust"
./what_do_I_need_to_do.sh
```

### 2. Critical Task to Start With
**[SEC-001] Implement OAuth2 client with authorization code flow**
- **Priority:** Critical 🔴
- **Estimated Time:** 16 hours
- **Phase:** 1 - Foundation & Architecture
- **Dependencies:** ARCH-001 (✅ completed)

### 3. Quick Task Check Commands
```bash
# Show what's next
./what_do_I_need_to_do.sh next

# Show urgent tasks only
./what_do_I_need_to_do.sh urgent

# Show project status
./what_do_I_need_to_do.sh status

# Open full task list
./what_do_I_need_to_do.sh full

# Run Rust task manager
./what_do_I_need_to_do.sh run
```

---

## 📋 WHAT'S BEEN COMPLETED

✅ **SPEC-001** - Created comprehensive project specification  
✅ **ARCH-001** - Designed core integration framework and traits  

**Files Created:**
- `PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md` - Complete engineering specification
- `TASK_MANAGER.md` - Master task list with 157 tasks
- `src/integrations/mod.rs` - Core integration framework
- `src/bin/task_manager.rs` - Rust task management tool
- `what_do_I_need_to_do.sh` - Quick reminder script

## 🚨 TASK OVERLOAD WARNING

The project has **157 total tasks** across 6 phases. This is a large undertaking!

**Recommendations:**
1. **Focus on Phase 1 only** (Foundation & Architecture)
2. **Complete OAuth2 first** (SEC-001) - it's critical for all integrations
3. **Use the task manager** to stay organized
4. **Break down large tasks** into smaller chunks if needed

---

## 🔧 DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS

```bash
# Build and test
cargo build
cargo test

# Run main application
cargo run

# Run task manager
cargo run --bin task_manager status
cargo run --bin task_manager next
cargo run --bin task_manager urgent

# Check specific phase
cargo run --bin task_manager phase 1
```

## 📊 PROJECT STATUS

- **Total Tasks:** 157
- **Completed:** 2 (1.3%)
- **Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Foundation & Architecture
- **Next Milestone:** OAuth2 Authentication Framework
- **Estimated Completion:** October 2025

---

## 🎯 PHASE 1 PRIORITIES

1. **Security Infrastructure** (Critical)
   - OAuth2 client implementation
   - Token management system
   - Secure credential storage

2. **Integration Framework** (High)
   - Complete PlatformIntegration traits
   - Plugin loading system
   - Configuration validation

3. **Observability** (Medium)
   - Structured logging setup
   - Metrics collection
   - Health check endpoints

---

## 📖 KEY FILES TO REFERENCE

- **`PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md`** - Complete engineering plan
- **`TASK_MANAGER.md`** - Detailed task breakdown
- **`src/integrations/mod.rs`** - Integration architecture
- **`README.md`** - Project overview and setup

---

## 💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS

1. **Start Small:** Begin with OAuth2 (SEC-001)
2. **Use the Tools:** The task manager will keep you organized
3. **Stay Focused:** Don't jump ahead to later phases
4. **Test Everything:** Write tests as you build
5. **Document Progress:** Update task status as you go

---

**Remember:** This is a 13-week project. Take it one task at a time, starting with OAuth2 authentication! 🔐

Run `./what_do_I_need_to_do.sh` anytime you need a quick reminder of what's next.
