# Odaseva Engineering Standards

## Executive Summary
Based on analysis of Odaseva.com and their core business principles, this document establishes engineering standards for enterprise-grade data protection and analytics platforms.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Enterprise Reliability & Resilience**
- **Field-tested in rigorous environments**: Code must be battle-tested for enterprise scenarios
- **Proven and auditable**: All systems must provide comprehensive audit trails
- **Business continuity**: Zero-tolerance for data loss or extended downtime
- **Performance optimization**: Systems must handle enterprise-scale workloads efficiently

### 2. **Security-First Approach**
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify
- **Encrypted data at rest and in transit**: All sensitive data must be encrypted
- **Compliance-ready**: Built-in support for regulatory requirements (DORA, GDPR, etc.)
- **Secure by design**: Security considerations integrated from the ground up

### 3. **Total Visibility & Monitoring**
- **"You can't manage what you can't see"**: Comprehensive observability
- **Real-time monitoring**: Live dashboards with actionable insights
- **Record-level granularity**: Track down to individual data points
- **Advanced Analytics**: Trend analysis and predictive capabilities

### 4. **User Experience Excellence**
- **Simple, secure way**: Complex functionality with intuitive interfaces
- **Fastest Implementation**: Quick time-to-value for customers
- **Best Support**: User-centric design and comprehensive help systems
- **Professional presentation**: Enterprise-grade UI/UX standards

### 5. **Data Protection & Lifecycle Management**
- **Backup and restore**: Reliable, testable recovery procedures
- **Real-time compliance**: Continuous policy enforcement
- **Data archiving**: Efficient long-term storage strategies
- **API optimization**: Smart resource consumption patterns

## Technical Standards

### Code Quality
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% unit test coverage
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline and external documentation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and meaningful error messages
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times for critical operations
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capabilities built-in

### Architecture
- **Microservices**: Loosely coupled, independently deployable services
- **Event-driven**: Asynchronous processing where appropriate
- **API-first**: Well-defined, versioned APIs
- **Database**: ACID compliance and backup strategies
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics, logging, and alerting

### Security
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication support
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Encryption**: AES-256 or equivalent for data at rest
- **Audit Logs**: Immutable audit trails for all operations
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular security assessments

### User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance**: < 3s load times, smooth interactions
- **Consistency**: Design system with reusable components
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support ready

## Compliance Requirements
- **DORA Compliance**: Digital Operational Resilience Act readiness
- **Data Sovereignty**: Regional data residency options
- **Audit Ready**: Comprehensive logging and reporting
- **Industry Standards**: SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR compliance

## Quality Gates
1. **Code Review**: Peer review required for all changes
2. **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive tests
3. **Security Scan**: Automated vulnerability scanning
4. **Performance Testing**: Load testing for critical paths
5. **Documentation Review**: Technical writing standards
6. **User Acceptance**: UX validation and accessibility testing

## Success Metrics
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Performance**: P95 response time < 500ms
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities in production
- **User Satisfaction**: NPS score > 50
- **Recovery**: RTO < 4 hours, RPO < 1 hour
